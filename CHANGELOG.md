# Changelog

## [Unreleased] — 2026-03-17

### Added

**Security**
- Pipe-to-shell hard stop (universal): `curl | bash`, `wget | sh`, `eval $(curl ...)`, `bash <(curl ...)` blocked in ALL modes including crazy-workspace
- Privilege escalation hard stop (universal): `chmod 777`, `chmod -R 777`, `sudo` to system paths blocked in ALL modes
- Secrets detection before every auto-commit: filename patterns (`.env`, `*.pem`, `*.key`, etc.) and content signals (`sk-`, `ghp_`, `AKIA`, `-----BEGIN RSA`, `password=`, etc.); applies in all modes including crazy-workspace; cannot be overridden
- Path traversal clarification: symlink escapes, `..`-normalized paths, `$HOME`/`~`/`$XDG_*` expansions that exit cwd now block shell auto-pass

**Automation**
- `/hands-free dry-run`: preview what would be auto-accepted without enabling hands-free or changing state
- `/hands-free pause` / `/hands-free resume`: temporarily suspend auto-accept without changing mode; paused state shown in status
- `/hands-free explain`: trace the reasoning behind the most recent auto-accept decision
- `/hands-free reset`: clear all learned preferences with confirmation prompt (always pauses, never auto-accepted)
- `/hands-free review-checkpoints on/off`: structured pause-and-summarize before costly phase transitions; two mandatory checkpoints (before execution, before push/merge)
- Iteration warnings in ralph-loop: print at 3 and 2 remaining iterations; mandatory PAUSE at 1 remaining
- Git-log-based loop state detection: concrete algorithm using `git log --oneline -20` + `git status --short`; five-state decision table replaces heuristic prose

**UX / Documentation**
- Quick Reference table at top of skill: maps user intent to commands; includes "Always blocked" reminder
- `/hands-free status`: fully defined with mode, learning, auto-commit, review checkpoints, pause state, loop-aware state, session decisions, and tiered hard stop lists
- Recommended Setup: expanded from single line to use-case table covering 5 scenarios
- Mode transitions: defined mid-session switching behavior; `partial` auto-enables review-checkpoints
- Conflict resolution: priority rules when two skills present simultaneous approval points
- Session log: added 6 new event types (`[review-checkpoint]`, `[auto-commit]`, `[verification]`, `[hard-stop]`, `[user-override]`)
- "When There Is No Recommended Option": pick learned preference, then first-listed, then log and continue
- Custom Skill Integration: documented how hands-free recognizes approval patterns in non-superpowers skills
- Preference staleness: downgrade rules when user repeatedly contradicts a learned preference
- Preferences scoping: global (not per-project); added "What NOT to record" guidance
- Auto-commit edge cases: 6 scenarios (no changes, no git repo, hook failure, secrets in staged files, git add failure, untracked-only)
- Shell examples: added `cargo build`, `make build` (auto-pass); `curl|bash`, `wget|sh`, `eval$(curl)`, `chmod 777`, `sudo /etc/` (HARD STOP)

### Fixed

- Crazy-workspace activation announcement: now lists all 5+ hard stops (was listing only `rm -rf *` and `rm -rf .git`)
- Crazy-workspace "Two absolute hard stops": updated to "Absolute hard stops (no exceptions, no override)"
- Crazy-workspace decision flowchart: updated to check pipe-to-shell, chmod 777, secrets in addition to rm -rf patterns
- HARD STOP section: restructured into two-tier (universal vs standard); git push/merge now annotated as crazy-workspace overrideable within `./`; removed duplicate "crazy-workspace too" block
- Status output: `git push` moved from flat "Active hard stops" to "Mode hard stops"; `secrets-in-commit` and `Paused:` field added
- Red flags table: clarified mode-specific vs universal stops; added "crazy-workspace allows everything" misconception row
- Command comment for `crazy-workspace`: updated from "except rm -rf * and rm -rf .git" to "5 universal hard stops remain"
- `/hands-free recommend` section: added explicit "will NEVER suggest" rule for universal hard stops
- Frontmatter description: updated to reflect all current capabilities (was stale, mentioned only 3 modes)

### Changed

- Mode behavior table: added `curl | bash`, `chmod 777`, secrets, and review checkpoint rows (19 rows total, up from 10)
- Auto-commit safety rules: expanded from single bullet to full secrets detection procedure with filename/content patterns
- Shell auto-pass rules: added symlink escapes, normalized `..` paths, `$HOME`/`~`/`$XDG_*` as path-escape conditions
- README mode table: expanded from 5 rows to 13 rows; added crazy-workspace column; includes all new hard stop patterns
- README commands section: all 16 commands documented including dry-run, pause/resume, explain, reset, review-checkpoints
- README "What it does": added pipe-to-shell/secrets blocking and review checkpoints; updated "Three modes" to "Four modes"

## [Unreleased] — 2026-03-16

### Changed

- **crazy-workspace mode**: Simplified behavior description — auto-approve all operations within `./` without the redundant qualifier. Hard stops remain: `rm -rf *` and `rm -rf .git`.
